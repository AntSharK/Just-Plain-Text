You meet Chickenman at night. Chickenman is out fighting crime dressed as a chicken.
However, because this is a small village, the only crime being committed is someone acting suspicious and sneaking around while being dressed as a Chicken.

Brews Rain is the son of police chief Max Rain, who is very much alive. Brews Rain wants to have "crime to fight" by making you deem certain things as illegal.
Alternatively, Brews Rain just wants something to do. Like establishing a fight club.

------
First encounter

Brews Rain comes to you with a proposal to criminalize extra-marital affairs.
On the surface, this is to promote family values and also raise extra funds from fines.
However, enforcing this is problematic. Brews Rain volunteers very enthusiastically to break into people's homes at night for investigative purposes.
It becomes fairly clear that Brews Rain just wants an excuse to break into people's homes.

You can:
- Tell Brews Rain that he is crazy and ignore him from the get-go. Note that this requires a lot of insistance, and Brews Rain will complain. A lot.
- Buy into Brews' logic and reject him on that front.
  - Your values differ
  - It is not for you to judge
- Agree with Brews but differ on how to enforce this
  - Let him enforce it
  - Leave enforcement to the officials
  - Leave enforcement to other religious agencies

------
Second encounter

If you very rightfully have decided not to sanction Brews Rain as legal town burglar, then he will be bored and come back with another idea.
Brews Rain will invite you to join his Fight Club.

Brews Rain will talk about how the Chickenman problem is caused by bored people with pent up frustrations.
He believes in the need to have a place to physically beat the shit out of strangers. That will solve the issue.
It might even stop villagers from feeling the need to terrorize others by dressing up as chickens in the night.

You can:
- Ignore this crazy person.
- Agree to fund a fighting tournament
- Agree to have a secret fight club
- Say that Chickenman is a sad isolated example and in no way represents the rest of the villagers.
- Convince Brews Rain to do something better with his aggression. If other options have presented themselves, this includes:
  - Chopping wood
  - STEALING FROM NEIGHBORING VILLAGES

Other things

Depending on your choices, you can have interesting conversations with the police chief, Max Rain, about his son, Brews Rain.
The police chief will hear about Chickenman from other villagers but believes it's a civil matter - for you to tell people not to go around scaring others dressed as a chicken.
If you give authority to other bodies to enforce criminal actions, Max also has an issue with this.

Some people also are assaulted by Chickenman after he "catches" them doing things (e.g. collecting eggs at night from their own farm).
