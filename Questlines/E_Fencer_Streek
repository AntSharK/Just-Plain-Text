Fencer is the richest person in town. However, Fencer doesn't actually make things. He just buys and sells things, and no one knows where the money comes from.
Fencer is, of course, trying to make more money. 
Fencer's support, of course, goes to the leader whom he can bend to his will. 

------
Before encounter:
- Fencer is not directly mentioned. However, his actions are. There are several interactions which mention the rising price of eggs, omelettes, and chickens.
- Several times, it is mentioned that becoming an egg trader is much more profitable than being an egg farmer.

------
First encounter:
Fencer needs you to allow him to buy larger quantities of eggs. Through some terrible market manipulation, Fencer has driven the price of eggs up.
And Fencer has also managed to preserve a large quantity of omelettes. This means that he can sell the omelettes for a huge profit.
However, egg sellers have started getting suspicious and are no longer selling that many eggs to him. Fencer believes this is a violation of his free-market privileges.

You can dig as far as you want into this scheme. It turns out that Fencer is profiting off an egg-bubble, artificially driving up the prices of eggs.
He is not alone. Many people are hoarding omelettes and eggs. Lots of chickens are being raised.

You can opt to:
- Just give Fencer what he wants
- Shut down Fencer's operation
- Impose economic restrictions on eggs
- Do nothing

Clearly, economic policy is complicated, and effects are far-reaching. Fencer might not be heard of again, but the egg-bubble affects many other people.

------
Consequences:
If the egg bubble is left alone, it will crash.
It turns out that Fencer was also selling egg-laying chickens at a premium - and people who bought these chickens will be in huge debt to Fencer.
No matter what you do, Fencer will find some other way to manipulate the market and get rich.
