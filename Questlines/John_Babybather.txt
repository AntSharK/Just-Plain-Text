John Babybather is a missionary for the "Faith of great addition" (FOGA). He has amassed a group of religious followers, but FOGA is still treated like "a group of wierdos".

John needs your favor for 2 things:
- To build a chapel
- To punish "sinners" who have eaten the meat of the sacred fish

Ultimately, John wants to create a FOGA-run village, like many of the other villages around. But this agenda won't take place within the week.
John is also rich A.F.

------
Before encounter: FOGA is described as a weird but harmless cult. A few "weird uncles in FOGA" have been described.

------
First encounter: John wants to build a chapel. He was in the middle of working out details with the previous leader, or so he claims.
You can find out more about what FOGA is about.
John is extremely direct with the resources he is able to acquire. Helping FOGA will give you favor from other rich FOGA civilizations.

You can choose to:
- Agree to build the chapel but only with the promise of more riches
- Agree to build the chapel
- Disallow the chapel to be built
- Banish John
- Banish John and disallow practicing of FOGA

------
Second encounter: If your first interaction with John is favorable, John will be back with another favor. He will request your help in punishing sinners.
These sinners have been caught eating the diamondfish. This is against FOMA teachings.
These sinners are also not FOMA believers.
Diamondfish is a common fish in the area that primarily feeds on mosquito eggs. Your ecologist believes that diamondfish single-handedly keep the mosquito population in check.

The point being that it's probably good to not kill these fish. But these people did nothing illegal, that they know of.

You can choose to:
- Outlaw the killing of diamondfish because FOMA forbids it
- Outlaw the killing of diamondfish
- Control the supply/demand of diamondfish strictly
- Do nothing

w.r.t. the "sinners" you can also choose to:
- Do nothing
- Apologize to them for their mistreatment in the hands of FOGA
- Punish them in the name of FOGA
- "Punish" them in the name of FOGA (i.e. a slap on the wrist just to set an example)
- Fine them in the name of the environment

------
More encounters: If you treat any other religion/cult/remotely-spiritual group favorably, John will come to you requesting that you make them cease their practices.
Doing anything other than agreeing with John will result in his disfavor.
