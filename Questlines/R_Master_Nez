Master Nez is a Zen master who has gathered a following, by no fault of his own, without any intention.
Master Nez's first name is "Master".

Master Nez and his followers will seek your help together - and it is apparent that Master Nez has nothing to do with what his followers want.
Master Nez' followers are trying to build a school/church so they can discuss and teach Master Nez' teachings. 

Master Nez doesn't quite want more followers and doesn't really want to start anything big.
However, it seems, to his dismay, that his followers have started calling themselves "Nezzines" and practice "Nezziness". He really doesn't want it.

The Nezzines have no ulterior motives. They truly only just want to start a school and give people a proper "Nezzine education".
They won't promise you anything or ask you for anything else.

The fundamental concepts of Nezziness are:
- Train your brain! It's important!
- Chill! Stop bothering other people! (ironically a Nezzine's enthusiasm for Nezziness is extremely bothersome)

That's pretty much it. Let people do what they want, get out of the way, and go read a book.

------
Before the encounter: There will be noise complaints and annoyance complaints about Nezzines. Nezzines are teaching their kids all kinds of weird stuff.
Nezzines are giving children weird puzzles to waste their time. etc. 

------
First encounter: Master Nez and his group of Nezzines want to build a school.
Most of the talking will be done by the lead Nezzine (who isn't Master Nez), Bobba.
Bobba explains that they really want to get out of everyone's way and stop bothering people, and for that they need a place of congregation.

By itself this seems like a harmless request - but granting the Nezzines a school will make every other religious group very unhappy.
This also angers any workers who don't want their kids reading books.

You can:
- Choose to grant their request. Seems easy enough.
- Disallow them to build anything.
- Ban their practice.

------
Second encounter: If you have chosen to ban their practice or grant their request, Master Nez will come speak to you silently.
Master Nez says he regrets any disruptions and really doesn't want to start a cult or anything.
He just wanted to be left alone, do his puzzles, and read his books.

You can:
- Tell Master Nez that things are already in motion and there's nothing you can do
- Convince Master Nez to actually get his followers to disband. This is the best-ish option for you since this allows you to garner support from other religious groups. It's, however, very difficult.
- Rescind your offer to build a school. This makes everyone unhappy.
- Sneakily delay the building of the school ad-infinitum. This requires pulling some strings to keep everyone happy.
