"This is Boo Lin. He's a Logician."

Jaq saw the bearded middle-aged man fumble around with a stack of paper. He pointed at the flaming house, and shuffled the stack around.

"He's the kind of guy who plays cards while watching the world burn?" Jaq thought to himself. But then, to his astonishment, he realized that the flames which had once consumed the house were nowhere to be found.

Gil beamed at the balding, slightly pauchy "Logician" as he put his cards away. "Another fine piece of real estate salvaged!" she exclaimed.

"Child's play... easy peasy..." smiled Lin, raising a hand up to greet Gil. "It's not just a figure of speech. I've really been putting out fires for fun since I was a kid." He said, somewhat wistfully.

"Gil, Jaq. Jaq is the most recent Tabula Rasa. First one in the last decade."

"Tabula Rasa? My, it's been a hwile since the last one." He reached out his right hand in a rehearsed motion. "Boo Lin. BrightHand Insurance. Sometimes I also dabble in Asset Protection."

"Are there many with your skill set?" Asked Jaq. Being a Tabula Rasa, he figured he'd be given ltos of leeway to "satisfy his curiousity". And the earlier he made an impression as a harmless curious idiot, the easier it would be for others to give him information.

"Unfortunately... most of my order was nullified when our temple burnt down." Said Boo Lin defeatedly, like a man being reminded of the time he had caught his sister in bed with a goat (a purely hypothetical situation that Jaq had no idea how he had come up with). "But that is a story for another time."

Jaq glanced at Gil, and the smirk on her face confirmed it: this was a story he would have to earn.
