"Logicians have the ability to cause logical relationships to manifest in the real world."

"So, say this egg is undercooked." Boo Lin said, tossing Jaq an egg. He took out two pieces of paper, wrote "egg" and "cooked" on them.

"The egg is now undercooked." He stated, placing the word "egg" under the word "cooked."

"Now, it is overcooked" he said, moving the pieces of paper around. He peeled the eggshell, revealing a blackened interior.

"All of that is a little bit of reality manipulation to bind the concepts of 'over' and 'under' to convey both relative physical location and relative amounts of time."

"Holy crap, so you can manipulate reality as you see fit?" Asked Jaq.

"In theory, yes." Replied Boo Lin. "But the human mind is only capable of so much imagination. That's why we need these sheets of paper to guide us."

"Hold this for me." Said Lin, handing Jaq a piece of toast below the burnt egg. He took out a piece of paper with the word "easy" on it, and with a bit of shuffling, ended up with eggs, overeasy, on toast.
