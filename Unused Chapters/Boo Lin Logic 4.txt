"The popular way to put out a fire" said Boo Lin, taking out a stick and setting one end alight using campfire "is to, essentially, do this." He took out two pieces of paper, and covered the piece that said "fire" with the piece that said "stick". "See, the stick is now on fire." He said as he balanced the papers on the palm of his hand.

In a quick shaking motion, he made the top piece of paper slide off. "And now, the stick is not on fire."

"Some people have difficulty with this whole concept of negation. And truthfully, even though most Logicians eventually get the hand of how to do it, they never really understand why or how it works. Logic really isn't an exact science..." Boo Lin trailed off, pondering the ill-phrasedness of his statement.

"Anyway," he continued "a much riskier way to put out fires is to take that phrase quite literally." Boo Lin set another stick on fire and took out just a single piece of paper with the word "fire" on it. He paused for a while, then threw the piece of paper away.

"See that, I literally put the fire out."

"There is a chance, however slim, that when both methods are used in conjunction, they'll interact in complex undesirable ways. Like causing entire buildings to crumble instead of extinguishing the fire."

A more detailed explanation would take half a lifetime of learning, or so Jaq thought, at least. So he refrained from further clarifying the mechanics of such an interaction - even though Boo Lin was in a rare, revalatory mood.
